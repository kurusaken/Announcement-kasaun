<p>
	The main protagonist, an eighth grader nicknamed Mob, is an Esper with powerful psychic abilities. Helmet hairstyle is his defining physical feature. He is not good at reading the atmosphere, and since childhood, he has rarely felt or displayed intense emotion. He thinks his power is not necessary in his life, so he avoids using it. He suppresses his emotions to keep his power in control, but when the percentage of his accumulated feelings reaches 100, he is overcome by the strongest emotion he is feeling at the time and unleashes the full extent of his powers. He works at Reigen's spirit counsel for 300 yen an hour. When he was asked to join the Telepathy Club so they wouldn't be disbanded, he was introduced to the Body Improvement Club, which he then joined to become popular, in order to impress his secret love. He is also credited as Salt Middle School's "secret school gang leader known as White T Poison but this fact remains unknown to many including himself. Shigeo also possesses an unknown power which far surpasses even the height of his abilities, but is uncontrollable and only awakens when unconscious.
